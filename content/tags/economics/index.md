Economics is the core research focus for Chaotic Good Computing. Wherever there is a finite amount of resources and an infinite capacity for demand, an economy forms.

CGC's focus is analysis & creation of well-balanced and intentionally-designed economies, particularly in digital spaces. Whether it's players interacting with game systems or each other, the way you interact with your cloud provider, or even the way you work online at your company, well-designed systems are hard to understand and even harder to perfect.
