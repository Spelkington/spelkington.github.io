[The Arc Browser](https://arc.net/gift/3389bea4) is probably the first tool that slayed off a [[the-quest-to-slay-the-goblin|series of shake-ups]] on how I use technology to put up guard rails on being able to start - and stay - focused. It was also on their blog that I discovered [Maggie Appleton's blog](https://arc.net/l/quote/abfpadro) - so in a way, it was very much a half-step into a pool of ideas that have helped me come to terms with the slightly-more-than-standardly chaotic way that I tend to work.

At some point, I'll do a review here.
