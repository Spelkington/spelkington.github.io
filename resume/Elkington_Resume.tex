%   SUPER COOL RESUME TEMPLATE
%
%   Resume Template by Spencer Elkington, for the
%   purposes of the U Professional Education Program.
%
%   Welcome to your new resume! I'll be annotating how to apply the concepts
%   from our resume workshop below.
%   
%   Feel free to delete this top bit if you ever post the source online - take
%   credit for all of this amazing work, if you really want!
%
%   SOME BASICS:
%   
%   Anything with a '%' (percent sign) before it is COMMENTED CODE. This will keep
%   it from appearing in the final LaTeX render. I use it for two reasons:
%
%     1. Making comments like these.
%     2. Omitting things from my resume that I don't want NOW, but may want LATER.
%
%   Things will come and go from your resume - some experiences you have may not
%   feel applicable to a job you're currently applying for - DO NOT DELETE THEM.
%   You never know when experience may become relevant again!
%
%   COMMENT IT OUT USING '%', because then you can whip out your experience again
%   when you need it!
%
%   Also, sometimes it's a cool confidence booster to un-comment everything and see
%   all the neat stuff you've done so far in your professional life :)
%
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%  PACKAGES AND OTHER DOCUMENT CONFIGURATIONS
%
%   These are some document-wide settings and extra LaTeX packages that you may
%   want to use for your resume. Here, you can adjust:
%     -   Margin Sizes
%     -   Indentation
%     -   Hyperlink Appearance
%
%   You will also use this section to put your NAME and CONTACT INFORMATION. This
%   stuff is very very important and I would highly recommend keeping the format
%   fairly similar. This is based on advice I've received from our alumni and other
%   job recruiters.
%
%   A NOTE ON FORMATTING: Your resume should NEVER EVER EVER be more than ONE PAGE.
%             
%             Muliple pages is best left to a CV, and unless you are
%             a highly-qualified individual (read: decades of experience
%             in your field) you really should leave it to ONE PAGE.
%
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% Use the custom resume.cls style
\documentclass{resume/resume} 

% Document margins
\usepackage[left=0.75in,  top=0.4in,  right=0.75in,   bottom=0.3in]{geometry} 

% Stuff for setting default indentation for new paragraphs
\newcommand{\tab}[1]{\hspace{.2667\textwidth}\rlap{#1}}
\newcommand{\itab}[1]{\hspace{0em}\rlap{#1}}

% Package for proper item listing
\usepackage{enumitem}

% Package for... changing pages? I'm not too certain, and I'm not going to look it up right now.
\usepackage{changepage}

% Package for another thing I don't know about and will not look up right now.
\usepackage{parskip}

% Package for multiple columns! I'm not even sure what this is being used for. :)
\usepackage{multicol}

% Package to use *fancy* accented letters!
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

%-----------------------------------------
%
%   NOTE:
%   
%   I personally like having hyperlinks to the neat stuff that I do in my resume! Especially
%   if you do not have a portfolio website, it's a fun way to directly connect digital viewers
%   of your resume to the stuff that you've done.
%
%   NOT EVERYBODY FEELS THIS WAY. It is up to your discretion whether or not you use
%   hyperlinks.
%
%   My advice, though:
%     - Keep hyperlinks set to a dark, neutral color. This will make them non-abrasive
%     compared to the black of the rest of your text, AND will make them appear normal
%     should anybody print out your resume.

%
%  SUMMARY
%
%   If you are so inclined, you can put a summary for yourself. MAKE IT BRIEF, like
%   the tagline of a movie. A longer summary is GREAT for your LinkedIn, but the space
%   on a resume is usually better suited for things like education and experiences.
%
%   Depending on when I want it, I will comment/uncomment this section.
%
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{center}
 \vspace{-1em}
 {\em
%  Engineering solutions for market and organizational friction points with reliable design and automation.
%  Uncovering stories about markets and organizations with advanced analysis and intuitive explanations.
%  Finding exciting trends \& insights in data to solve
 }

%
%  EDUCATION SECTION
%
%   For a student, this should be the FIRST SECTION on your resume! It's the
%   signal that lets people know - you're going to be graduated candidate!
%
%   DEFINITELY HAVE:
%     -   Your University
%     -   Your Major(s), Minors, and Certificates (if applicable)
%     -   Your graduation date. If you do not know, USE YOUR EXPECTED GRADUATION DATE

%
%   RELEVANT TOPICS
%
%   The following is subject to debate!
%
%   I, the mighty and benevolent creator of this template, like to put my technical
%   skills under the Education section. As a student, it feels applicable.
%
%   It is well within reason to split this into a separate skills section. People
%   recommend it all the time. Just for them, here's two magic line of code to make it
%   happen:
%
%     \end{rSection}            % End education
%     \begin{rSection}{Technical Skills}  % Start Technical Skills
%
%   There! Magical!
%   
%   This section is, if we're being honest, mostly for the benefit of the bots. Recruiters will
%   sometimes use an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to organize resumes. These systems are
%   built to compare your resume to sets of keywords and, if you don't match the keywords
%   well enough, then into the digital abyss your resume goes.
%
%   The system below is for your benefit! It allows you to organize and hot-swap keywords
%   that apply to you. Uncomment the keywords that apply best to the job you are applying
%   for.
%
%   To verify you've covered the right keywords, I highly recommend using jobscan.co.
%   It allows you to check your resume against the job description, to make sure you
%   have as many of the keywords the ATS may be looking for as possible.
%
%   BE AWARE: WHEN YOU ARE COMMENTING/UNCOMMENTING ITEMS, DO NOT LEAVE TRAILING COMMAS.
%

%
%   SKILLS/RELEVANT COURSEWORK
%     - Class topics (DO NOT PUT CLASS CODES HERE.)
%     - Independent study subjects
%     - Soft skills that you happen to be good at.
